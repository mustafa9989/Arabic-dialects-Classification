# Arabic-dialects-Classification
This project focuses on predicting Arabic dialects using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to develop accurate models using machine learning and deep learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), M-BERT, and Arabert. The models are trained on a dataset retrieved from a database.
